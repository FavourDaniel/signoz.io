This is the source for the signoz.io website and docs at signoz.io/docs built on docusaurus 2

# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

yarn install
```

## Local Development

yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
